On each turn, you can turn over any two cards (one at a time).&#10;    2. To open a card, simply clicking on them&#10;    3. The board will show you the selected card.&#10;    4. If you successfully match a pair you receive a point, and you get &#10;       another turn.&#10;    5. The found pair is removed from the board.&#10;    6. When you select two cards that do not match, those cards are turned &#10;       face down again (in the same position) and you get to try again.&#10;       One life is subtracted (Hearts next to the menu)&#10;    7. The trick is to remember which cards are where.&#10;    8. The Game is over once you have either found all pairs before running&#10;       out of lives, or have no more lives&#10;    &#10;&#10;    1.2 Playing against the time&#10;&#10;    1. On each turn, you can turn over any two cards (one at a time).&#10;    2. To open a card, simply clicking on them&#10;    3. The board will show you the selected card.&#10;    4.

When you select two cards that do not match, those cards are turned &#10;       face down again (in the same position) and you get to try again.&#10;    7. The trick is to remember which cards are where and to find all cards&#10;       before the time runs out.&#10;    8. The Game is over once you have either found all pairs before running&#10;       out of time, or have no more lives&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    2.Multiplayer &#10;&#10;    1. On each turn, a player turns over any two cards (one at a time).&#10;    2. To open a card, simply click on them&#10;    3. The board will show your selected card.&#10;    4. If a player successfully matches a pair they receive a point and that &#10;       player gets another turn.&#10;    5. The found pair is removed from the board.&#10;    6. When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are &#10;       turned face down again (at the same position) and it becomes &#10;       the next player's turn.&#10;    7. The trick is to remember which cards are where.&#10;    8. The person with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.&#10;    &#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;We hope you have fun with this game!&#10;Your developers,&#10;Quirin, Jan, Isabella, Daqian and Florian&#10;" />
